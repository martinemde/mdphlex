<examples>
<example id="1">
<user>
Review this Ruby method for improvements:
```ruby
def process_items(items)
  results = []
  items.each do |item|
    if item.valid?
      results << item.process
    end
  end
  results
end
```</user>
<assistant>
I'll analyze your Ruby method and suggest improvements.

The method can be refactored to be more idiomatic and concise using Ruby's enumerable methods:

```ruby
def process_items(items)
  items.select(&:valid?).map(&:process)
end
```

Key improvements:
1. **Use `select` and `map`**: More idiomatic than manual array building
2. **Symbol-to-proc syntax**: `&:valid?` is cleaner than blocks
3. **Method chaining**: Reads naturally left-to-right
4. **No temporary variable**: Eliminates the `results` array

This refactored version is more functional, easier to test, and clearly expresses the intent.</assistant>
